# Steps

VICTORIA - I've removed the requirement that you have me approve your Pull Requests before you can merge them. I realized you'd be stuck sitting there waiting for me to log on and do it, so I'm going to instead have you PRETEND I've reviewed your code before you merge each of your PRs. For each "I will approve the Pull Request" step below, go ahead and approve your own Pull Request (you may need to look up how to do that online since we didn't cover that yet). Good luck! I know you'll figure this all out with a little practice and Googling!

Please complete all steps below, using the hints in HINTS.md as needed. Good luck!

 -	Pull any recent changes from the repo to your local machine using whatever command is used for that (make sure you're on the *main* branch when you do this)
 -	Create a new branch, name it "victoria_AaronFile"
 -	Add a new file called Aaron.py
 -	Put a print statment in the new file
 -	Use whatever commands are needed to push that change to GitHub for me to review
 -	Switch back to the main branch on your local machine
 -	Create a new branch, name it "victoria_VictoriaFile"
 -	Explain to me why Aaron.py is not showing up after you switched to the victoria_VictoriaFile branch
 -	Add a new file called Victoria.py
 -	Put a print statment in the new file
 -	Use whatever commands are needed to push that change to GitHub for me to review
 -	Switch back to the main branch on your local machine
 -	Explain to me why neither Aaron.py or Victoria.py are showing up
 -	Tell me when you're at this step and I will approve the Pull Request adding Aaron.py
 -	Merge your Pull Request in GitHub after I've approved it
 -	Explain to me what has happened with the code in your approved Pull Request as it pertains to the main branch in GitHub
 -	Explain to me why Aaron.py still does not appear in the main branch on your local machine
 -	Pull in any recent changes from the repo to your local machine using whatever command is used for that
 -	Explain to me why you see whatever changes you see on your local machine
 -	Tell me when you're at this step and I will approve the Pull Request adding Victoria.py
 -	Merge your Pull Request in GitHub after I've approved it
 -	Explain to me what has happened with the code in your approved Pull Request as it pertains to the main branch in GitHub
 -	Explain to me why Victoria.py still does not appear in the main branch on your local machine
 -	Pull in any recent changes from the repo to your local machine using whatever command is used for that
 -	Explain to me why you see whatever changes you see on your local machine (you should see both Aaron.py and Victoria.py now)
 -	Create two new files, A.py and B.py
 -	Add a print statement to each file
 -	Use whatever commands are needed to push ONLY A.py to GitHub for me to review
 -	Explain to me what you did and why only A.py is in your new Pull Request on GitHub
 -	Use whatever commands are needed to add B.py to your existing Pull Request
 - Explain to me why B.py is now in the Pull Request
 - Tell me when you're at this step and I will approve the Pull Request
 - Pull in any recent changes from the repo to your local machine's main branch using whatever commands are used to do that
 - Explain to me why you see whatever changes you see on your local machine
